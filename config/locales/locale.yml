              Codebreaker is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to break a secret code \n
              created by a code-maker. The codemaker, which will be played by the application \n
              weâ€™re going to write, creates a secret code of four numbers between 1 and 6. \n
              The codebreaker gets some number of chances to break the code (depends on chosen difficulty). \n
              In each turn, the codebreaker makes a guess of 4 numbers. The codemaker then marks the guess \n
              with up to 4 signs - + or - or empty spaces. A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers \n
              in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code and in the same position.\n
              For example:\n
              Secret number - 1234\n
              Input number - 6264\n
              Number of pluses - 2 (second and fourth position)\n
              A - indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers \n
              in the secret code but in a different position. For example:\n
              Secret number - 1234\n
              Input number - 6462\n
              Number of minuses - 2 (second and fourth position)\n
              An empty space indicates that there is not a current digit in a secret number.\n
              If codebreaker inputs the exact number as a secret number - codebreaker wins the game.\n
              If all attempts are spent - codebreaker loses. 0Codebreaker also has some number of hints \n
              (depends on chosen difficulty). If a user takes a hint - he receives back a separate digit of the secret code.\n\n"
